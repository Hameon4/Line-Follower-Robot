# Obstacle-Avoidance-Vehicle
Final Semester Group Project for Embedded Systems

The aim of this project was to design a robotic vehicle that's capable of following a line, regardless what the arrangement of the line looked like. Several tools were needed to accomplish this goal. Tracking sensors were used to distinguish the difference between the black and white colors on the course. One of the tracking sensors was used to detect obstacles whenever there was one and the color sensor was used to detect different colors, mainly just the blue square in this project, and will respond upon the way we programmed the vehicle.

Unfortunately, the video demo file is too big to fit here :(
